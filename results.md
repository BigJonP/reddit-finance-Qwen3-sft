| **Response**   | A thing to remember about debt. Since it sounds like your mother did not have any estate to leave you, keep in mind that any debts she may have had (credit cards and the like) are *NOT* your legal responsibility. If you get calls from anyone saying that she owes money, inform them that she passed away and that there is no estate for them to collect the money from. Reputable companies will ask for proof of death (typically a copy of the death certificate) and then leave you alone. If they try to push you into paying them, refuse and block their number. | You're absolutely on the right path, and it's important to remember that recovery from loss and hardship is a journey, not an end.

How to find your profitable setups?I have been learning technical analysis for a year now but still not able to find my profitable setups. I know the basic indicators, patterns, fib lines, support and resistance, breakout-breakdown, volume, etc.. But seems like I always get lost when I am trying to find a strategy which has a 2-1 risk reward and maybe works 60% of the time. Can anybody tell me how to approach the previous price action data and find my own profitable setups or create my own profitable strategy?

| **Response**   | Finding profitable setups is not the hard part. It's the mental block we have in our heads that keeps us from seeing that something is profitable. You have to be very honest with yourself about what your real problems with finding a profitable setup is. If you cannot be honest with yourself you'll never find one. <br><br>Mine personally was the need to find a perfect setup and avoid losses. It took me a while to realize I was doing this even though I didn't think I was. Once I did I found I had several working strats on my hands. I have learned patience and to wait for the market to come to me and accept losses as part of the game. You have to figure out what it is that is really holding you back.

Title : Who can get there first - Tesla or $CyberPrototype? The real 1000x hidden gem üöÄYes, you got that right - this is indeed a competition! Since CyberTruck is not yet released by Tesla, the question is who can get there first - Tesla, founded by the Elon Musk himself, by releasing the CyberTruck, or our token $CyberPrototype by getting to a 25 M market cap and giving away a fully stacked, preordered CyberTruck to one lucky holder?

The project was started by the developers of HOGL and SHIELD. Their initial idea was to create a rug-free project for the community with a chance to win a CyberTruck at a 25 M market cap. Do not worry, they are still with us and are 24/7 advising us from the back seat of a CyberTruck. The newly formed team has decided to take it even further, and will not only be giving away a CyberTruck away, but will also donate to various charities, which aim to reduce CO2 emissions (Yes, we are fully ELETRIC).

Ownership renounced. LP is locked.  Marketing wallet is in the hands of HOGL, so it is totally safe. The project is rug-free. What is more, all the whales are out!

The market cap is now sitting at only 100k, so this is a perfect 1000 x opportunity. 

There are 50 000 000 000 tokens circulating and we are still burning, 95 % already burnt (without releasing any CO2. so no worries about that!).

801 and NSCC-002 June 21 - repost from userPreface from me user 
I‚Äôm reposting this for visibility because I think it provides some important insight that hasn‚Äôt been discussed for a while. For whatever reason I couldn‚Äôt crosspost this. Beyond this, I‚Äôm going to leave the post as it was originally. 

Disclaimer: These are not my original ideas or words. The views represented here are not mine, rather those I thought important to discuss. 

Weeny edit: keep in mind this information is retroactive to ~40 days ago so when it‚Äôs saying ‚Äúthis Friday‚Äù it‚Äôs Friday from several weeks ago. That said, the June 21 date hasn‚Äôt changed and that‚Äôs why I wanted this reposted - because it‚Äôs judgement day is upon us. 

Another Weeny edit: I removed the references to previous days because it was confusing people. 

801 and NSCC-002

CREDIT TO user FOR STRUCTURE AND INFO

I haven't seen as much talk about this, yet it is the biggest news to come and IT IS the endgame catalyst.

NSCC-801 Passed with no objections. For this rule to enter effect it needs to piggyback on NSCC-002, which if no objections are made again, will be passed June 21. Let me remind you just how powerful 801 really is...

Once 801 enters effect, all hedgefunds holding short positions will be monitored Every. Single. Minute. They will have to report EVERY SINGLE MINUTE their value in short positions versus their actual money on hand. If they fail to report or their short position value crosses the threshold where it is higher than their money on hand, it is an immediate warning to deposit the funds needed to cover within ONE HOUR. Failure to do so leads to the NSCC immediately overriding operations and liquidating the hedge funds entirely, one after another until all that is left is the trillions in insurance.

This is bigger than anything, This is so big, that this rule will prevent a squeeze even a fraction of this magnitude from happening ever again. It is that powerful, and with its implementation of this stage of the game... good lord.

If NSCC-002 passes we have officially entered the squeeze. Hedgefunds will be on a leash that gets tighter the more they pull. Starting in after hours, they will be under so much pressure and restriction that one of two outcomes occur:

1.) Their ability to short will be at such a minimum that our buying power will just break through sell walls and the price will just continue to rise and rise until they can no longer afford to suffer the loss and margin comes a calling, or.

2.) There will be strong final blows of sell off aggression and shorting, literally out of pure ignorance and recklessness which will activate NSCC-801, and thus the great fall of the hedgies via margin call.

Remember they passed the rule that changed reporting from once a month to anytime for any reason. They can be spot audit unlimited times and for them to run under the radar will require their books to be radioactive.

I threw this up to let everyone know what is up with the end game posts and the severity of the situation. Nobody knows OP. It's not about OP. It's about digesting the information here.
