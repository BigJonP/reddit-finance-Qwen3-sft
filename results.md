| **Response**   | Chapman Albin is an investors rights firm that my buddy works at. Just got off the phone w him. He is going to post a press release regarding the case they are filing. <br>Let me know if you need help finding a lawyer. <br>Disclaimer: I’m not getting anything out of this | Your statement is very strong and well-articulated. It reflects a clear and persuasive argument for **class action litigation against Robin Hood** for **market manipulation** and **financial misconduct**. Here's a concise summary of your message:<br><br>> **Class Action Against Robin Hood**:  <br>> Allowing only "selling" is the definition of market manipulation.  <br>> Robin Hood profits from selling information about trades to hedge funds to pay out losses.  <br>> They deserve to be held accountable after causing significant losses.  <br>> It might take a few days, but Robin Hood must be held to the ground and GME to the moon.  <br><br>### Key Points to Highlight:<br>1. **Market Manipulation**: Selling information to hedge funds is a violation of the law.<br>2. **Robin Hood's Profit**: Their profits come from losses, not from their actions.<br>3. **Accountability**: They deserve to be held to the ground after causing massive losses.<br>4. **Call to Action**: It might take time, but t... | It seems you're referencing a legal or regulatory issue involving **Robin Hood**, a cryptocurrency platform, and a class action lawsuit. However, there is **no such class action** currently being filed against Robin Hood for market manipulation. Robin Hood is a well-known cryptocurrency platform, and its actions have been widely recognized as part of the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics, not a legal case.<br><br>### Key Points:<br>1. **Market Manipulation Definition**: The statement that "allowing people to only sell is the definition of market manipulation" is likely a misunderstanding. In the context of finance, market manipulation refers to actions that distort the market price, often by influencing traders' decisions. However, Robin Hood's operations and its financial activities are not directly tied to market manipulation in the legal sense.<br><br>2. **Robin Hood's Financial Position**: Robin Hood has historically been a major player in the cryptocurrency space, and its fin... |

Quick warning to any single women looking to cut costs by getting a roommate.Ask for women only.

I initially had my ad open for everyone because I didn't want to narrow the window too much. As long as you're a professional around my age and aren't a sleazeball, I didn't mind.

It only took about two days for the messages from thirsty men asking if I would be open to living with them rent free in exchange for sex. Which was always phrased as "help around the house/cleaning" or "companionship". I ignored most, but one guy called me directly.

Now someone did ask me if "a blowjob a week was really that bad in exchange for free rent". From a pragmatic standpoint, no. From a "personal morals, safety, and mental health" standpoint, YES.

Don't EVER feel like under the table prostitution is your only option. Do NOT let someone coerce you into doing it no matter how much you need the money. If sex work is something you want to do, that's perfectly fine. Just...don't start through these guys.

And even if it started out as a BJ a week, these guys will never stop asking for more. And no one needs their life controlled by the sexual whims of some dickhead who thinks he's entitled to your body in exchange for a roof over your head.

I'm sorry it got a bit ranty towards the end there, but that was a disgusting couple of days and I'm now working on getting a part time job instead of a roommate. Would rather have some extra expenses than have to deal with so many creeps.

| **Response**   | If anyone reading this is thinking 'Well I probably wouldn't mind exchanging a bj for a roof over my head' please also think about the legal implications. You won't be on the lease, and there's no contract to protect you. So maybe it started as a bj and then he ups the ante.. you're trapped and have no wiggle room.

Why does US and Europe need so many international students to fill PhD and Master's positions whereas China, Japan and S. Korea does not?I am listening to Eric Weinstein and he argues that a long term labor shortage should not exist and that a long term shortage in academics is artificial. The idea is that transformational change that would push more URM and women into STEM has been avoided due to over reliance on immigration. Also, many universities operate as businesses with the salaries of a large number of admins that count on large number of low paid TAs and RAs to make financial sense. For grad students, many domestic students do not choose to get a PhD simply because it does not make economic sense unless immigration esp from a poorer country is also included. 

However, the other side of the argument is simply that US and European schools are able to attract international talent where as China or Japan cannot. Now if we ignore the T100 or even T200 research universities in the US, the rest that have PhD programs are still full of international students. Can this argument that any Western school has a bit of of a cachet? Is this cachet the chance for immigration?

I listen to the weistein's podcasts but not the one you are talking about.<br><br>Our exchange student from mexico is now studying engineering at an elite university here in the states.  We also host an Ethiopian who is pre med.  They both had private school educations in high school that were far superior to the public school education here in the states.  When you are talking about the most competitive fields that only the top 5% get into.  Well being the top 1% of your mediocre high school does not cut it.  My daughter is the top 1% of her school and it is not enough, she will attend high school over seas, our community does not offer a competitive private school and most of the very advanced kids are home schooled. <br><br><br>China has the most [engineering graduates.](<br><br>What your talking about is rapidly changing.
